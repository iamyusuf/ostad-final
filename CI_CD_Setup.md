# CI/CD Setup Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive CI/CD pipeline architecture implemented for the Finch application, consisting of both frontend (Vue.js) and backend (Django) components.

## CI/CD Tool: GitHub Actions

We have chosen GitHub Actions as our CI/CD platform due to its:
- Native integration with GitHub repositories
- Extensive marketplace of pre-built actions
- Parallel job execution capabilities
- Built-in secrets management
- Cost-effectiveness for open source and small teams

## Pipeline Architecture

### Frontend Pipeline (`frontend-ci.yml`)

The frontend pipeline consists of the following stages:

#### 1. Test Stage
- **Environment**: Ubuntu Latest with Node.js 18
- **Dependencies**: Installs npm dependencies using cache
- **Linting**: Runs ESLint for code quality checks
- **Unit Tests**: Executes Jest/Vue Test Utils with coverage reporting
- **Build**: Creates production build artifacts
- **Artifacts**: Uploads build files for potential deployment

#### 2. Security Scan Stage
- **Dependency Audit**: Runs `npm audit` to identify vulnerabilities
- **Snyk Scanning**: Performs security vulnerability scanning
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs concurrently with test stage for efficiency

#### 3. Build and Push Stage
- **Triggers**: Only on push to main/develop branches after tests pass
- **Multi-platform**: Builds for both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures
- **Caching**: Utilizes GitHub Actions cache for faster builds
- **Registry**: Pushes to Docker Hub with semantic versioning
- **SBOM**: Generates Software Bill of Materials for security compliance

#### 4. Deployment Stages
- **Staging**: Deploys develop branch to staging environment
- **Production**: Deploys main branch to production with manual approval
- **Health Checks**: Monitors rollout status and validates deployment

### Backend Pipeline (`backend-ci.yml`)

The backend pipeline includes:

#### 1. Test Stage
- **Environment**: Ubuntu Latest with Python 3.11
- **Services**: PostgreSQL 15 and Redis 7 for integration testing
- **Code Quality**: 
  - Flake8 for linting
  - Black for code formatting
  - isort for import organization
- **Testing**: 
  - Unit tests with pytest
  - Integration tests with Django test framework
  - Coverage reporting with codecov

#### 2. Security Scan Stage
- **Safety**: Checks for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Bandit**: Static security analysis for Python code
- **Snyk**: Additional vulnerability scanning
- **Reports**: Generates security reports as artifacts

#### 3. Build and Push Stage
- **Docker**: Multi-stage build for optimized images
- **Security**: Trivy vulnerability scanning of built images
- **SARIF**: Upload security results to GitHub Security tab
- **Registry**: Push to Docker Hub with proper tagging strategy

#### 4. Deployment Stages
- **Database Migrations**: Automated migration execution
- **Zero-downtime**: Rolling deployment strategy
- **Health Checks**: Kubernetes rollout status monitoring

## Triggering Pipelines

### Automatic Triggers
- **Push to main**: Triggers full pipeline including production deployment
- **Push to develop**: Triggers pipeline with staging deployment
- **Pull Requests**: Runs tests and security scans only

### Manual Triggers
- Production deployments require manual approval via GitHub Environments
- Emergency hotfix deployments can be triggered manually

## Monitoring Pipelines

### GitHub Actions Interface
1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Select the specific workflow (Frontend CI/CD or Backend CI/CD)
3. View real-time logs and status of each job

### Status Badges
Add these badges to your README.md:

```markdown

![Backend CI](https://github.com/roy35-909/finch-backend/workflows/Backend%20CI%2FCD%20Pipeline/badge.svg)
```

### Notifications
- **Slack Integration**: Deployment notifications sent to #deployments channel
- **Email**: GitHub automatically sends failure notifications to commit authors
- **Status Checks**: PR merge requirements based on pipeline status

## Environment Configuration

### Required Secrets

#### Docker Hub
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Docker Hub password or access token

#### Kubernetes
- `KUBE_CONFIG_STAGING`: Base64 encoded kubeconfig for staging cluster
- `KUBE_CONFIG_PRODUCTION`: Base64 encoded kubeconfig for production cluster

#### Security Scanning
- `SNYK_TOKEN`: Snyk authentication token for vulnerability scanning

#### Notifications
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK`: Slack webhook URL for deployment notifications

### Environment Protection Rules

#### Staging Environment
- No protection rules (automatic deployment)
- Used for integration testing and UAT

#### Production Environment
- Required reviewers: DevOps team members
- Deployment window: Business hours only (configurable)
- Wait timer: 5 minutes before deployment

## Best Practices Implemented

### Security
- Multi-stage Docker builds to minimize attack surface
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis
- Secrets management through GitHub Secrets
- Image signing and SBOM generation

### Performance
- Parallel job execution where possible
- Docker layer caching
- Dependency caching (npm, pip)
- Multi-architecture builds

### Reliability
- Health checks and rollout monitoring
- Database migration automation
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Automatic rollback on failure

### Compliance
- Test coverage reporting
- Security scan results
- Audit trails through GitHub Actions logs
- SBOM generation for compliance requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Pipeline Failures
1. **Test Failures**: Check test logs and coverage reports
2. **Build Failures**: Verify Dockerfile syntax and dependencies
3. **Security Scan Failures**: Review vulnerability reports and update dependencies
4. **Deployment Failures**: Check Kubernetes cluster status and resource limits

#### Access Issues
1. **Docker Push Failures**: Verify Docker Hub credentials
2. **Kubernetes Deployment Failures**: Check kubeconfig and cluster connectivity
3. **Secret Access**: Ensure secrets are properly configured in repository settings
